QRPlop is a site to enable people to do stupid things with QR codes.

At the very least we're going to allow you to easilly make a qr code that links to an image.

I'm thinking of adding qrs that point to markdown text, redirects, and maybe something fun like
scavenger hunts, so like you can't actually access a QR code until your session has visited a 
previous QR code in a previous browser session.  I don't know yet.

Hopefully it won't suck.  I'm planning on hosting it on dotcloud, and at the very least it's
going to have:

nginx
dancer
mongo
s3

but we'll see.
